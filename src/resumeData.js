      Achievements: `As a Full Stack Web Developer at Luca, the leading E-Learning platform for primary schools based in Mexico, I worked directly on the development of Luca version 2.0 from scratch.

      For the front-end, we use React and Apollo Client.
      Currently i'm working as a Full-Stack Developer at Luca, and as part of my responsibilities, I am in charge of maintaining and developing new features for the platform, as well as optimizing and refactoring existing code with the aim of achieving a basic solid, scalable and clean code.
      In this role, i apply my technical skills to develop creative and efficient solutions that meet the needs of our users. Additionally, i work closely with my team to ensure projects are delivered on time and quality standards are met. 
      I have also the opportunity to apply my problem solving and critical thinking skills to identify and solve problems quickly and effectively, which has allowed me to significantly contribute to the success of the platform. 
      In short, working at Luca has been (and it is) an enriching experience that has allowed me to continue growing as a developer and apply my skills in a challenging and rewarding environment.`,
